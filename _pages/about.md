The goal of my research is to develop machine learning approaches that can configure themselves automatically by learning from past data. In the long term, I hope that my work will contribute to fulfilling the promise of artificial intelligence and lead to complete end-to-end learning systems.

More specifically, my research interests include:
 - Automated machine learning
 - Neural architecture search
 - Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
 - Model compression of large language models
 - Automated prompt engineering


### short bio

I am the head of the AutoML research group at [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai/) (Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence) in Leipzig. I am also a co-host of the virtual [AutoML Seminar](https://automl-seminars.github.io/) as part of the ELLIS units in Berlin and Freiburg. 
Alongside my collaborators, I lead the development of the open-source library [SyneTune](https://github.com/awslabs/syne-tune) for large-scale hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.

Until 2024, I worked as an applied scientist at AWS, where I was part of the long-term science team of SageMaker, AWS's machine learning cloud platform, and the science team of Amazon Q, the GenAI assistant of AWS.
Prior to that, I finished my PhD at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of [Frank Hutter](http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/hutter/) in 2019. In 2022, my co-authors and I won the [best paper award](https://2022.automl.cc/index.html%3Fp=603.html) at the AutoML Conference. My collaborators from the University of Freiburg and I won the ChaLearn AutoML Challenge in 2015. I co-organized the workshop on neural architecture search at [ICRL 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/nas2020) and [ICLR 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/nas2021/), respectively and served as local chair for the [AutoML Conference](https://2023.automl.cc/) in 2023. I also regularly serve as a reviewer for ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TMLR, and JMLR.
