My goal is to build automated learning systems that are able to configure themselves without human intervention. More specifically, my research focus is on hyperparameter and architecture search of deep neural networks as well as more general AutoML.


### short bio

I am an applied scientst in the long-term science team of AWS SageMaker, where I work on large-scale distributed hyperparameter and architecture search. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Freiburg under the supervision of [Frank Hutter](http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hutter/). In 2015, me and my collaborators from the University of Freiburg won the ChaLearn AutoML Challenge.
I co-organized the workshop on neural architecture search at ICRL 2020 and ICLR 2021, respectively.

Together with [Giovanni Zappella](https://giovannizappella.github.io/), [Arber Zela](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/zela/index.html) and [Jovita Lukasik](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/researchers/phd-students/jovita-lukasik/) I run the virtual [AutoML Seminar](https://automl-seminars.github.io/) as part of the ELLIS units Berlin and Freiburg. 
I also regularly serve as reviewer for ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS and JMLR.
