I lead a research group at the [ELLIS Institute Tübingen](https://institute-tue.ellis.eu/) as part of [OpenEuroLLM](https://openeurollm.eu/), a European initiative developing a family of foundation models for European languages. Our team focuses on advancing automated methods for large-scale pre-training of large language models.

I also co-host the virtual [AutoML Seminar](https://automl-seminars.github.io/), organized by the ELLIS units in Berlin and Freiburg.

My research interests include:

- AutoML, which aims to progressively automate various stages of the machine learning pipeline. Within AutoML, I primarily work on hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search.

- Blackbox Optimization (or gradient-free optimization), with a focus on Bayesian optimization methods.

- Model compression of large language models to reduce resource consumption during inference.

Previously, I headed the AutoML research group at [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai/) (Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence) in Leipzig.

Until 2024, I worked as an applied scientist at AWS, where I was part of the long-term science team behind SageMaker, AWS’s machine learning cloud platform, as well as the science team for Amazon Q, AWS’s generative AI assistant.

I earned my PhD at the University of Freiburg in 2019 in the [machine learning lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) under the supervision of Frank Hutter.
In 2022, my co-authors and I received the [Best Paper Award](https://2022.automl.cc/index.html%3Fp=603.html) at the AutoML Conference. Earlier, in 2015, my collaborators from the University of Freiburg and I won the ChaLearn AutoML Challenge.

I have co-organized the Neural Architecture Search workshop at [ICRL 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/nas2020) and [ICLR 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/nas2021/), and served as the local chair for the [AutoML Conference 2023](https://2023.automl.cc/). I regularly review for top-tier venues including ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, TMLR, and JMLR.
